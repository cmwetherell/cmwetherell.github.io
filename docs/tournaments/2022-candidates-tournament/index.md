The field is set, and the eight candidates are in Madrid, ready for the 2022 iteration of the [Candidates Tournament][wiki]. Lot's of storylines to follow with this torunament:

- The young prodigy Alireza hasn't played an OTB event since 2021; will he be rusty?
- Magnus has stated that he's likely to not play another WC match unless it's against Alireza, what will he say as the tournament unfolds? 
- Hikaru Nakamura will draw tons of attention to the tournament - if we were to win, a WC match against El Magneto would bring a sonic boom to the chess world dring that matcup. 
- Meanwhile, Ding Liren is the favorite based on my simulations, but many pundits are also projecting Nepo and Caruana to perform well.

In any case, we're in for three exciting weeks of chess!

**The Field**

| Name           |   Classic |   Rapid |   Blitz |
|:---------------|:---------:|:-------:|:-------:|
| Ding Liren     |      2806 |    2836 |    2788 |
| Firouzja       |      2793 |    2670 |    2791 |
| Caruana        |      2783 |    2766 |    2847 |
| Nepomniachtchi |      2766 |    2821 |    2740 |
| Rapport        |      2764 |    2802 |    2613 |
| Nakamura       |      2760 |    2837 |    2850 |
| Duda           |      2750 |    2808 |    2779 |
| Radjabov       |      2738 |    2747 |    2684 |

Why am I including Rapid and Blitz ratings in a **Classical** tournament that is being played to determine who will go on to fight for the **Classical** chess world championship? Because there is a **whopping 22% chance the event is decided in Rapid or Blitz tiebreaks!** Of note, Firouzja's Rapid rating is likely well below his skill level. If his true skill level is higher than his current rating, I'm understating his chances of winning by about 2% below.

At long last! Here are the probabilities of each player winning:

Ding Liren is the favorite, but only by 2.5%. Realistically, everyone has good winning chances, which will make for an exciting tournament. **I'll keep this page updated as the tournament progresses, be sure to check back then!**
