The field is (almost) set, and the eight candidates will head to Madrid in June for the 2022 iteration of the [Candidates Tournament][wiki]. Ding Liren is fighting for (and likely to get) the last spot which opened up when Sergey Karjakin received a six month ban from FIDE.

**The Field**

| Name           |   Classic |   Rapid |   Blitz |
|:---------------|:---------:|:-------:|:-------:|
| Ding Liren     |      2810 |    2836 |    2788 |
| Firouzja       |      2804 |    2670 |    2791 |
| Caruana        |      2781 |    2784 |    2744 |
| Rapport        |      2776 |    2785 |    2646 |
| Nepomniachtchi |      2773 |    2821 |    2740 |
| Nakamura       |      2759 |    2850 |    2850 |
| Radjabov       |      2753 |    2747 |    2705 |
| Duda           |      2750 |    2806 |    2760 |
{: .field}

Why am I including Rapid and Blitz ratings in a **Classical** tournament that is being played to determine who will go on to fight for the **Classical** chess world championship? Because there is a **whopping 22% chance the event is decided in Rapid or Blitz tiebreaks!** Of note, Firouzja's Rapid rating is likely well below his skill level. If his true skill level is higher than his current rating, I'm understating his chances of winning by about 2% below.

At long last! Here are the probabilities of each player winning:

| Name           |  Win %|
|:---------------|:-----:|
| Ding Liren     |  18.6 |
| Firouzja       |  15.0 |
| Caruana        |  14.5 |
| Nepomniachtchi |  13.8 |
| Rapport        |  13.1 |
| Nakamura       |  10.4 |
| Duda           |   7.5 |
| Radjabov       |   7.2 |

Ding Liren is the favorite, but not by much. Realistically, everyone has good winning chances, which will make for an exciting tournament. **I'll keep this page updated as the tournament progresses, be sure to check back then!**
