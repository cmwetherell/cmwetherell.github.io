### How many points do I need to win?

Heading into the back half of the tournament, every player needs to ask themselves this question. Pawnalyze is here to help!

So far I've run over [500,000 simulations][sims] with results through Round 7, and we can inspect the simulations to figure out how likely each player is to win if they achieve a certain score.

Ok... now shut up and show us the data!

In order of most likely to win the event, to least:

How to read the graph: If Nepo scores 9 points, he wins just over 80% of the time. If he scores only 8.5 points he wins 50% of the time. It's worth noting that some of the wins come from playing in tiebreaks, unfortunately, I didn't split that out when making the graphs.
