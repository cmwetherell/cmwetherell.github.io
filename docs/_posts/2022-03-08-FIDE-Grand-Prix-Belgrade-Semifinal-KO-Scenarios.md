### How the odds change with each result

This post will be quick. No fancy tables or interactivity - just the cold hard numbers! Check out the [bracket][b] I built if you want to see some more scenarios.

I ran 1,000 simulations for each scenario. The numbers should be at most 1-2% off, but I'll run some more robust simulations once the games are over and we will know for sure!

I *think* Andreikin has the white pieces against Giri and Rapport has the white pieces against MVL. 

**If Andreikin beats Giri:**
<br>Giri wins semi: 0.221
<br>Andreikin wins semi: 0.779
<br>
<br>**If they draw:**
<br>Giri wins semi: 0.694
<br>Andreikin wins semi: 0.306
<br>
<br>**If Giri wins:**
<br>Giri wins semi: 0.964
<br>Andreikin wins semi: 0.036
<br>
<br>**If Rapport beats MVL:**
<br>Rapport wins semi: 0.855
<br>MVL wins semi: 0.145
<br>
<br>**If they draw:**
<br>Rapport wins semi: 0.432
<br>MVL wins semi: 0.568
<br>
<br>**If MVL wins:**
<br>Rapport wins semi: 0.066
<br>MVL wins semi: 0.934
