### But, what if?

That's the question **you** are about to explore. After winning Leg 1 in Berlin, we know that Hikaru Nakamura is the [most likely to qualify][odds] for the Candidates Tournament from the Grand Prix. But how likely is he to qualify if he lands on 20 points? 94%. In order to guarantee qualification, he will need to get 2nd or better in the 3rd leg. That said, in many scenarios where he doesn't even win his pool he still qualifies. 

In the chart above, you can explore all potential qualification outcomes for every player. Curious how likely Anish Giri is to qualify if he scores 17? Can Daniil Dubov qualify if he wins leg 3? Take a look. The data is based on 500,000 simulations.

As the tournaments unfolds I will be updating this page regularly. Each player may find interesting what needs to be accomplished in order to achieve qualification. Is it worth fighting for a win with the black pieces to get to the knockout stage, or is it better to play it safe and take a draw, securing a particular spot in the pool? The intricacicies of final standings in tournament chess can be difficult to estimate intuitively - this tool is fun for us fans to look at, but could also be useful to the players as well!
