My name is Caleb Wetherell. I live in Seattle, WA and I am interested in chess. I am not good at chess. I am a data scientist and serial hobbyist, so I find fun projects like this to learn and keep myself entertained.

The data presented here is the result of a Python program I created that simulates chess tournaments. Right now, the code is in terrible shape and needs to be refactored - but it does the job for now.

Ideally, this site will evolve into something more user friendly over time where you can explore some of the data for yourself (e.g. what if Magnus loses his next game?) For now, you just get to see my conclusions.

Thanks for visiting!
