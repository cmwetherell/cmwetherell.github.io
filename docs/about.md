Check out the new version of [Pawnalyze](https://www.pawnalyze.com) here!

My name is Caleb Wetherell. I live in Seattle, WA and I am interested in chess. I am not good at chess. I am a data scientist and serial hobbyist, so I find fun projects like this to learn and keep myself entertained.

The data presented here is the result of a Python program I created that simulates chess tournaments. You can see the code on [my GitHub][git].

I also recently launched a project called [Elocator][elocator] which you might find *interesting*.

Thanks for visiting!
