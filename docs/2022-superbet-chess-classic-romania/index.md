### So jumps in front, Firouzja battles for an important draw
The [Grand Chess Tour][gct] kicked off today with the first of five events in Bucharest, Romania. Wesley So won against Shakh with the white pieces,and the other four games were a draw. Alireza Firouzja held a draw against the formidable Fabiano Caruana with the black pieces, no doubt one of his toughest games in the round robin.

Below you can find the probabilities for every player to win the tournament as of the end of round 1. This page will be updated after every round. You can read about the [methodology][meth] as well as the model I am using to make [individual game predictions][model].

*Soon: a pretty graph showing the probabilities as each round passes.*

Firouzja was the slight favorite to before the tournament started, but Wesley So is the new favorite after his victory in round 1. So is the only player on one point, and he has the white pieces against MVL in round 2 and will look to extend his lead.
