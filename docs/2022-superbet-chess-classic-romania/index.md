### Firouzja is slight favorite
The [Grand Chess Tour][gct] kicks off today with the first of five events taking place in Bucharest with a 10 player classical round robin. Alireza Firouzja is sure to draw headlines with his first classical tournament since breaking the 2800 Elo threshold after an incredible performance at the European Teams in 2021. He is also a considered a front runner to challenge Magnus Carlsen in the World Championship in '23 (the real one...). Firouzja will wield the black pieces against a formidable Fabiano Caruana in round 1.

Below you can find the probabilities for every player to win the tournament. This page will be updated after every round. You can read about the [methodology][meth] as well as the model I am using to make [individual game predictions][model].

*Pre-Tournament*
{: .narrow .pad}

| Name            | Win % |
|:----------------|------:|
| Firouzja        |  15.0 |
| Caruana         |  14.3 |
| Nepomniachtchi  |  12.4 |
| So              |  11.8 |
| Rapport         |  11.6 |
| Aronian         |  11.0 |
| Mamedyarov      |   9.3 |
| Vachier-Lagrave |   7.1 |
| Dominguez Perez |   6.9 |
| Deac            |   0.6 |

*Soon: a pretty graph showing the probabilities as each round passes.*

Firouzja is the slight favorite, and the probabilities are not that interesting yet because they mostly follow the ratings. But as the tournament progresses things will get more interesting as there will be imbalances between who has white games and black games left, the pairings that remain, etc.  So, be sure to check back!
