Go to www.pawnalyze.com to see the results of the code/simulations in action.

#### Notes:
- You are welcome to resue this code for other purposes. I've tried to document some things along the way but this repository is mostly for my own purposes.
- Files run are coded to run from the main folder, not the chess-sim folder (small impact on file strings).
- Send a pull request if you find and squash any bugs!

#### TODO:
- Make visualization code more automated (right not I have it in a notebook that I don't push to the GH repo)
- Cache model predictions in a dictionary to save time (this didn't dop anything useful)
