Go to www.pawnalyze.com to see the results of the code/simulations in action.

#### Notes:
- My visualization code isn't in this repo (yet)
- Files run are coded to run from the main folder, not the chess-sim folder (small impact on file strings).
- Send a pull request if you find and squash any bugs!
